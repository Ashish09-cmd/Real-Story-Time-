                Health Tips for Babies in Nepal: A Journey of Dedication and
                Expertise by Dr. Basnet
              </h3>
              <p>
                It speaks of and proves that one can accomplish what he wants by
                sacrificing his comfort: the journey of Dr. Narayan Bahadur
                Basnet from Sotang, a very remote and tranquil area, to the
                bustling city of Kathmandu. As one of six brothers and four
                sisters in his large family, he spent his early years in the
                remote hills of Nepal, where education was next to impossible.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Nevertheless, his passion for learning compelled him to complete
                his elementary education in his hometown (grades 1-4); he then
                headed to Salleri to continue at a higher level of study and
                finished grade 9. He later moved to Aiselukharka, where he spent
                a year before obtaining his School Leaving Certificate (SLC)
                from HMG, Nepal, in 1976.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Nurturing a firm belief in destiny from an early age, he drove
                into Kathmandu with a dream of being a medical doctor, with the
                mission of providing health tips for babies in Nepal. Thus began
                a long tale of ambition and hard work in the medical profession.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In his career, Dr. Basnet has enriched knowledge beyond measure
                so that parents can make sound decisions when raising healthy
                babies. The most interesting point about health tips for babies
                in Nepal encourages families to consider their children’s health
                before anything else.

                From Internship to Pediatric Cardiologist: Health Tips for
                Babies in Nepal
              </h4>
              <p>
                While doing the MBBS internship at Kanti Children’s Hospital,
                Dr. Basnet observed many children suffering from different
                ailments. Still, at the time, very few pediatricians in Nepal
                could tackle these problems. This inspired him to become a
                pediatrician to serve the children better. During his career, he
                has treated young patients and shared significant health tips
                for babies in Nepal that could help improve their well-being.
